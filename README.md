# Personal Website - Built in NextJS
<a href="https://nextjs.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-NextJS-blue.svg"/></a>

<strong>This project is my first attempt at building a portfolio website for myself.</strong>

# What is this?
This is the repoistory for all the code of my personal website, which I have built in NextJS. My intention of this website is to display both programming projects that I am working on, documenting the entire process, as well as other hobbies and interests of my own. I like to think of it as my own personal digital diary.
